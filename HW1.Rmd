#Creating a New Variable for Seasons

## 1 is spring, 2 is summer, 3 is fall and 4 is winter

```{r seasons, results='hide', message=FALSE}

```


#Wettest and Dryest Seasons

##Spring is the wettest season. Fall is the dryest season.

```{r WettestAndDryestSeasons, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

clim.mth3 = aggregate(clim4quarter, by=list(clim4quarter$Quarter), sum)

maxrain2 = max(clim.mth3$rain)
rowwithmax2 = which(clim.mth3$rain==maxrain2)

#Winter Precipitation by Summer Temperature


```{r graph, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}

Winter = subset(clim4quarter, Quarter==4)
Winter2 = aggregate(Winter, by=list(Winter$year), sum)

Summer = subset(clim4quarter, Quarter==2 & year<2016)
Summer2 = aggregate(Summer, by=list(Summer$year), mean)

fit = lm(Winter2$rain ~ Summer2$tmax)

plot(Winter2$rain ~ Summer2$tmax, xlab="Summer Average Maximum Temperature (C)", ylab="Winter Total Precipitation (cm)")
abline(fit)

```

#Graph Description

##There is a weak, non-sigificant positive relationship between summer average maximum temperature and winter total precipitation. Thus, years with warmer summers are weakly associated with having more precipitation in the winter.
